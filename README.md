Angular Slides
=============

<h2>Easy-to-make HTML slideshow</h2>
Powerpoint style slideshow capabilities in Angular JS, so can be built with pure HTML and CSS :D

Just add your slides to the slides folder with the name slideX.html, where X is the order you want the slide to the appear in the deck

In slideX.html, make sure the first thing in the DOM is a div with class 'slide' and then put your slide's content in there

That's it. Open up index.html in a browser and you should be good to go.

Perfect for hosting slides on the internet or making your presentations look a little flashier if you're a CSS guru.
Also perfect for people who hate Powerpoint (me) and like coding (me).

Use right/down/enter to go forward and left/up/backspace to go backwards.
